          <h3>SNEAKIFIED - THE BEGINNING â€¦ OF A LEGACY!!</h3>
          <p class="text-light">Sneakified had humble origins; it was a co-founded company with strong roots in its culture. When we established a men's outfitter in Cape Town in 2022, the groundwork was already in place. When one of the first sneaker businesses in Cape Town, named Bronx, opened its doors in 1989, the sneaker culture as we know it today was born.</p>

          <p class="text-light">The group came together and recognized a market potential to establish a premier, independent sneaker store, which led to the launch of the first Sneakified in Cavendish Square, Cape Town, in 2022. Today, Sneakified has several locations all throughout South Africa and has established a strong reputation as the nation's leader in the lifestyle and sports footwear industry.</p>
