          <h3>SNEAKIFIED - THE BEGINNING … OF A LEGACY!!</h3>
          <p class="text-light">Street Fever originated from humble beginnings; A family-owned business with roots entrenched deep in their heritage. The foundation was laid back in 1974 when the eldest of four brothers opened a men’s outfitter in Cape Town. The sneaker culture itself was created in 1989 with the opening of an outlet called Bronx, one of the first sneaker stores in Cape Town.</p>

          <p class="text-light">The brothers combined and saw an opportunity in the market to create a leading, independent sneaker store, culminating in the opening of the first Street Fever in 1996 in Cavendish Square, Cape Town. Fast forward to today and Street Fever boasts 124 stores across South Africa, along the way earning itself a reputation as a leader in the lifestyle and sports footwear category in the country.</p>
